Software reverse engineering is the art of analyzing how a program works without having access to its source code.
It is used in various contexts, such as analyzing malware, detecting vulnerabilities, analyzing execution performance, and rewriting a program whose source code has been lost...

Two techniques are possible for reverse engineering a program: dynamic and static analysis.
Dynamic analysis is the process of evaluating a program's behavior while it is running. This contrasts with static analysis, which examines code without execution.
These two techniques are both independent and complementary.

Regardless of the techniques used, a basic understanding of assembly language is essential.

## Tools for binary analysis (ELF/PE) 

### Dynamic analysis

* On linux
  * **[Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)** disassembler - Software Reverse Engineering Framework
  * **[REDasm](https://github.com/REDasmOrg/REDasm)** disassembler
  * **hexcurse** hexadecimal editor
  * **[objdump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objdump)**  disassembler which supports Intel and AT&T syntax
  * **strings** extract all strings from a binary file
  * **[radare](https://radare.org/)**  reversing toolkit
  * **nm** lists all symbols
  * **readelf** Displays ELF file metadata

* On windows
  * **IDA** disassembler
  * **[HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/programs.php)** hexadecimal editor
  * **Pied**, **[studPE](https://www.cgsoftlabs.ro/studpe.html)** Analyzes executable signatures to determine if binaries are compressed or encrypted
  * **PEview** : Displays PE (Protable Executable) file metadata

### Static analysis

* On linux
  * **strace** monitors and records all system calls made by a program
  * **ltrace** monitors and records library function calls made by a program
  * **gdb** gdb: the GNU Debugger, a powerful command-line debugger
  * **[edb](https://www.codef00.com/projects)** a cross-platform Qt based debugger
  * **lsof** lists all open files and network connections

* On windows
  * **NtTrace** monitors and logs all Windows API calls made by a program
  * **[OllyDbg](https://www.ollydbg.de/)** a assembler level analyzing debugger
  * **[TCPView](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview)** provides detailed listings of all TCP and UDP endpoints on your system.
  * **[DiskMon](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sysinternals/downloads/diskmon)** a system utility that logs and displays all hard disk activity
  * **[PortMon](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sysinternals/downloads/portmon)** a system utility for monitoring and logging serial and parallel port activity 
  * **[Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)** an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry, and process/thread activity
