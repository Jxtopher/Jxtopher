# Tooling for analyze forensic

{bdg-primary-line}`2010`

We present different tools for forensic analysis of the random-access memory.

## Mass memory analysis

Mass memory corresponding to all non-volatile, high-capacity media that can be written by a computer.

* `fdisk` : list of partition table
* `df` : list of mount point
* `losetup` : mount file
* The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT) : find file and stuff in mass memory 
* `sleuthkit` <http://www.sleuthkit.org>.
  * `blkcalc`: converts unassigned disk unit numbers and standard disk unit numbers.
  * `blkcat`: displays the contents of the file system data unit in a disk image.
  * `blkls`: displays data blocks in a file system.
  * `blkstat`: display details of a file system data unit (block or sector).
  * `ffind`: searches for file names that point to a specified metadata entry
  * `fls`: lists of file names in a file system
  * `fsstat`: displays system and statistical information on an image or other medium
  * `hfind`: search for a hash value in a hash database.
  * `icat`: displays a file on standard output, based on the file inode.
  * `ifind`: Find the metadata structure that allocated a given disk drive or file name.
  * `ils`: lists of all entered metadata, such as an inode
  * `img_cat`: output the contents of an image file.
  * `img_stat`: display the details of an image file.
  * `istat`: displays information relating to a file, according to its inode
  * `jcat`: display the contents of a block in the file system log.
  * `jls`: lists the contents of a file system log.
  * `mactime`: produces a timeline of MAC accesses to files whose metadata has not been destroyed
  * `mmcat`: displays the contents of a partition on stdout.
  * `mmls`: display the partition layout of a volume system (partition tables).
  * `mmstat`: show details about the volume system (partition tables).
  * `sigfind`: searches for the binary signature in a file.
  * `sort`: sorts files deleted (and recoverable) or present in an image according to the file type: exec, text, document, archive, audio, image, video, system, ...
  * `srch_strings`: show printable strings in files.
  * `disk_stat`: (currently Linux only) discovers the existence of a "Host Protected Area"


* `Autopsy`: Web interface for data analysis and recovery
* Other recovery tools: Fatback, Foremost, Ntfsundelete
* Other specific tools: galetta, pasco, rifiuti, ...
* `PyFlag`: Interface for data analysis and recovery
* Penguin Sleuth Kit: This is a live CD which contains the analysis tools

## Copy of mass memory

```bash
sudo dd conv=notrunc,noerror,sync if=/dev/sdd1 of=/home/user/Desktop/file.dd
```

* notrunc warns dd not to truncate the result on an error
* sync allows you to put `0` in instead of blocks that contain errors
* noerror allows `dd` not to stop when it encounters an error.

fsstat: displays system and statistic information on an image or other media

```bash
fsstat file.dd
```
Mount the image file:

```bash
losetup /dev/loop0 file.dd
mount -r /dev/loop0 mnt     #-r : read-only
```

List files with fls. It lists the files (r/r), folders (d/d), files and folders deleted: you will see a star (*) after **d/d** or **r/r**.

```bash
fls -f ntfs /dev/loop0
```
Same thing as before, this time, it directly scans the file created by **dd**

```bash
fls file.dd
```
Display the contents of a file with **icat** on standard output depending on the file inode

```bash
icat -f ntfs file.dd 29981-128-4
```

## Ram memory Analysis with Volatility

* What is the Operating System of this Dump file? (OS name) ?
```bash
volatility -f victim.raw imageinfo
```

* What is the PID of SearchIndexer?
```bash
volatility -f victim.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist
```
