# Server config

## Linux installation

File system mount:

 * `/` : ro,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async
 * `/home` : rw,suid,dev,noexec,auto,nouser,async
 * `/tmp` : rw,suid,dev, noexec,auto,nouser,async
 * `/var` : rw,suid,dev,noexec,auto,nouser,async

Be careful for the root directory, a read-only mount (ro) makes it impossible to modify the files. 
This may be intended in production, note that updates will not be possible. 
To modify the assembly, it is necessary to modify the `fstab` file in rescue mode.


## Root access management

* Installing sudo

```bash
su
apt install sudo
```
* Sudo configuration, edit the `/etc/sudoers` file. 
For example 'user' can have access to all root rights on the server add the following line:

```vim 
user      ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

## Authentication with a public/private key

It is recommended to have a unique public/private key for each machine and each user. 
The private and public key is located in the `~/.ssh/` directory. 
Sine OpenSSH version 6.5, it is necessary to use the `ed25519` algorithm.

Generating `ed25519` Key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "john@example.com"
```

Copy public key to file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

Add a new machine to your ~/.ssh/config file to enable automatic authentication.
```vim
Host newyork
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    Port 2222
    User jdoe
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    RequestTTY yes
    RemoteCommand tmux -u attach || tmux -u new
```

This configuration enables SSH connection multiplexing, allowing multiple sessions to the same host to share a single network connection, which speeds up subsequent connections and reduces repeated authentication prompts.
```vim
Host dev-server*
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 10m
```

## Configuring `sshd`

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to configure sshd.

* Prohibit password authentication

```vim
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords both PasswordAuthentication and
# ChallengeResponseAuthentication must be set to "no".
PasswordAuthentication no
```

* Prohibit root user authentication:

```vim
PermitRootLogin no
```

* Disable Empty Passwords
```vim
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

## fail2ban

```bash
apt install fail2ban
```
