# Initramfs mode

{bdg-primary-line}`2010`

Initramfs is a rescue mode that can be used in many kinds situations for troubleshooting of the operating system when the boot phase is broken.

The Goal is to restore the binary file `mount`.

The idea is to restore the mount binary file. It is located in the `/bin` folder. It is an essential file for starting the GNU/Linux operating system. We are going to do this test with a virtual machine: virtualBox type. The idea is to use whatever we have on hand, the operating system, the network (to download the mount binary file). We must not use a CD-ROM, or a USB stick that can contain the mount.

## Remove `mount` file

boot and remove mount

```bash
sudo cp /bin/cat  /bin/mount
reboot
```

## Boot in `initramfs` mode

Boot booter in `initramfs` mode, You must edit the `kernel` line which is located in the grub menu and boot afterwards.

```bash
linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.x.x-x-generic root=1
```

After booting in initramfs mode. 
You end up with a prompt. 
It is a rescure operating system that allows you to do basic tasks. 
Here are the steps to follow:

```bash
mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /root/
cp /bin/mount /root/bin/mount
reboot
```
With this three lines you have put the operating system back into service without any external help. 
You could do much more, for example you could do a chroot and do whatever commands you wanted.


## Restoring the mount package

We have booted normally, we will restore the mount package.

```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall mount
```
